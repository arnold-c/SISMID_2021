    "Now that we have a network ready to go, we are going to implement an algorithm to model disease transmission through this network: the *percolation model*. One approach to network epidemiology comes from physics, where researchers wanted to describe how a liquid can stochastically percolate through a semi-porous medium, like water percolating through sandstone. As it happens, this model can be readily adapted to describe how an infectious disease can \"percolate\" through a population. The percolation model can be worked out analytically, but today we will be working with it through simulation. To use a percolation model, we need to know two things: the contact network of our population, and the probability ($T$) that a contact will result in disease transmission, given contact between an infected and a susceptible individual. The probability of transmission ($T$), called *transmissibility*, is something that we generally try to estimate for a given disease based on data from real epidemics. The figure below illustrates the model/algorithm:\n",
