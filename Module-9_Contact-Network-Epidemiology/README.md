## About Contact Network Epidemiology

Interpreting population interactions as contact networks provides powerful
mathematical and computational frameworks for modeling infectious diseases.
This course introduces network concepts (e.g., nodes, degree, clustering, and
modularity), and analytical and simulation-based approaches to contact network
epidemiology. We will discuss both idealized and empirical networks and how
modeling assumptions affect the tractability of different methods.

Students will use simple analytical models to predict disease properties such as
threshold conditions, final sizes, epidemic probability, and epidemic dynamics.
They will use the Python programming language and NetworkX software library to
represent and analyze networks, construct epidemic simulations, and model
various intervention strategies.
