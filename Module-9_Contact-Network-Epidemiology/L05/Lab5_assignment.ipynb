    "An important tool for controling infectious disease is contact tracing.  This is particularly important in cases where an individual may be infectious without showing symptoms.  Many sexually transmitted diseases exhibit this pattern, but more significantly at the moment, COVID-19 has this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an infectious disease in which some individuals may transmit to their contacts even without showing symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at three scenarios.  \n",
    "- The first scenario is a basic SIR epidemic, where the course of an infection is $S \\to I \\to R$.  \n",
    "- In the second scenario, individuals are infectious prior to symptom onset.  The course of an infection is $S\\to E  \\to I \\to R$ where both the $E$ and $I$ stage are infectious, but the $E$ stage is asymptomatic (or \"presymptomatic\").\n",
    "- In the third scenario, some fraction of individuals are infectious but never become symptomatic.  Here the individuals pass through one of two paths: $S \\to I_1 \\to R$  or $S \\to I_2 \\to R$ where the $I_1$ state is asymptomatic and the $I_2$ stage is symptomatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate these, we will use stochastic simulation using the `EoN` python package.  We will work through an example for an $SIR$ epidemic without tracing.  Then we will add tracing to it.  After that, we will explore transmission from nodes that do not have symptoms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "`EoN` has built in tools for stochastic simulation of SIS and SIR epidemics.  However, they do not account for contact tracing.  Instead we will use a more flexible tool that runs slower, but allows us to include more complicated processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"simple contagion\" refers to a contagious process where two types of transitions happen:\n",
    "- transitions induced by a single neighbor, such as the $S \\to I$ transition in the SIS or SIR model or the $S \\to E$ transition in the SEIR model.\n",
    "- transitions induced by processes internal to the node such as the $I \\to R$ transition in the SIR model, the $I \\to S$ transition in the SIS model, or the $E \\to I$ transition in the model with presymptomatic transmission described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "`EoN` has a method `EoN.Gillespie_simple_contagion` which can simulate simple contagions.  However, we need to encode the status changes somehow.  We give an example below for how to encode an SIR simulation with it.  There are more examples  given in the `EoN` [documentation for `Gillespie_simple_contagion`](https://epidemicsonnetworks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Examples.html#non-sis-sir-processes-with-gillespie-simple-contagion) (and `EoN` has faster tools that specialize to simulating SIR epidemics).\n",
