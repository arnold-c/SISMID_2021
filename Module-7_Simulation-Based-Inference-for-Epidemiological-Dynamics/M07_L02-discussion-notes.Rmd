## Why change from Binomial to Negative Binomial

Allows for more variability, therefore can fit real data better. $k$ parameter
is equivalent to the over-dispersion parameter. As $k$ goes to infinity, results
in a Poisson distribution (equal mean and variance), and as $k$ goes to 0 then
more over-dispersion as greater variance.

$$
\sigma^2 = \mu + \mu ^{(2/k)}
$$
