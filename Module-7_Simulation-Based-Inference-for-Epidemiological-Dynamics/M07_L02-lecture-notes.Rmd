# Simulation of stochastic dynamic models

## Compartmental model (SIR)

-   Represented by flows between compartments

    -   Specify rates

-   Use a more generalized structure/notation as more flexible for later

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-11%20at%206.47.57%20PM.png){width="526"}

-   Here, the recovery rate $\mu_{IR}$ is constant, but the infection rate
    $\mu_{SI}(t) = \beta I(t)$ with $\beta$ being the **contact rate**

-   In the simplest form without demography, set all birth and death rates to 0

-   Useful to track the cumulative number of individuals who transition between
    compartments

    -   E.g. $N_{SI}(t)$ is the cumulative number of individuals from $S$ to $I$
        by time $t$

        -   Is a **counting process**

    -   Always non-decreasing in compartmental models

    -   Integer valued in discrete time, real valued in continuous time

-   Rewrite our standard equations using the counting processes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
S(t) &= S(0) - N_{SI}(t) \\
I(t) &= I(0) + N_{SI}(t) - N_{IR}(t) \\
R(t) &= R(0) + N_{IR}(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Differential equation representation (deterministic approach)

-   Can write analogous ODEs:

    -   Note that the rates are defined *per capita*, rather than overall, hence
        the need to multiple by the compartment

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dN_{SI}}{dt} &= \mu_{SI}(t) S(t) \\
\frac{dN_{IR}}{dt} &= \mu_{IR}(t) I(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Continuous time Markov representation (stochastic approach)

-   This can be modified into a continuous-time Markov chain model

    -   Markov chain allows model to be specified from transition probabilities
        along with initial conditions

        -   Defined within a small time interval ($t \to t+\delta$) and valid in
            the limit $\lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{h(\delta)}{\delta} = 0$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Pr [ N_{SI}(t + \delta) = N_{SI}(t) + 1] &= \mu_{SI}(t)S(t)\delta + o(\delta) \\
\Pr [ N_{SI}(t + \delta) = N_{SI}(t)] &= 1 - \mu_{SI}(t)S(t)\delta + o(\delta) \\
\Pr [ N_{IR}(t + \delta) = N_{IR}(t) + 1] &= \mu_{IR}(t)I(t)\delta + o(\delta) \\
\Pr [ N_{IR}(t + \delta) = N_{IR}(t)] &= 1 - \mu_{IR}(t)I(t)\delta + o(\delta)
\end{aligned}
$$

-   This is the chance of the event that exactly one person moves from $S$ to
    $I$ in the time interval $t \to t+\delta$

    -   $o(\delta)$ turns it into a probability

        -   $h(\delta) = o(\delta) \text{ to mean } \lim_{\delta \to 0} \frac{h(\delta)}{\delta} = 0$

### Simple counting processes

-   Assumption in making link between differential equation and Markov form

-   A simple counting process can only count one event at a time

-   Has limitation for what it can model

    -   May want to add randomness from multiple simultaneous events e.g.
        someone sneezing in a bus

# Euler's method

## Numerical solution of deterministic dynamics

-   Want to be able to get an approximation $\tilde{x}(t)$ of $x(t)$ for when
    you can't solve an ODE analytically.

    -   The gradient $dx/dt$ can be analytically computed and is approximately
        constant over a small time interval ($k\delta \le t \le (k + 1)\delta$),
        therefore, multiply the gradient by the time interval to get the
        approximation of the new value of $x(t)$

        -   $\tilde{x}\left((k+1)\delta \right) = \tilde{x}(k\delta) + \delta h\left(\tilde{x}(k\delta)\right)$

        -   Note that $\tilde{x}(t)$ is only defined when $t$ is a multiple of
            $\delta$ (not defined continuously)

        -   Works well when $\delta$ is sufficiently small

-   Reasons to use Euler's over other methods that may have better convergence:

    -   Simplest numerical method to solve ODES

    -   Extends naturally to stochastic models, both continuous-time Markov
        chains and stochastic differential equations (SDEs)

    -   Close approximation of the numerical solutions to a continuous time
        model is less important that would first appear

        -   ODE models are only close mathematical approximations to reality at
            reasonably large scale

            -   When substantial error expected, may not be any difference
                between using $\tilde{x}(t)$ and $x(t)$

        -   When simulating, only interested in how well $\tilde{x}(t)$
            describes the system of interest, therefore more important than the
            original model $x(t)$

-   We require $\delta$ to be small on compared to the timescale of the process
    being modeled in continuous-time modelling

## Discrete SIR model

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Pr [ N_{SI}(t + \delta) = N_{SI}(t) + 1] &= \mu_{SI}(t)S(t)\delta + o(\delta) \\
\Pr [ N_{IR}(t + \delta) = N_{IR}(t) + 1] &= \mu_{IR}(t)I(t)\delta + o(\delta)
\end{aligned}
$$

-   We want a numerical solution with state variables $\tilde{S}(k\delta)$,
    $\tilde{I}(k\delta)$, and $\tilde{R}(k\delta)$ and use out counting process
    framework:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{S}(k\delta) &= S(0) - \tilde{N}_{SI}(k\delta) \\
\tilde{I}(k\delta) &= I(0) + \tilde{N}_{SI}(k\delta) - \tilde{N}_{IR}(k\delta)\\
\tilde{R}(k\delta) &= R(0) + \tilde{N}_{IR}(k\delta)
\end{aligned}
$$

There are at least three different ways of applying Euler's method to our
stochastic process:

1.  Poisson approximation

    1.  Over a small $\delta$, rate of new infections occurs at rate
        $\mu_{SI}S(t)$ is a Poisson distribution random variable

    2.  $\tilde{N}_{SI}(t+\delta) = \tilde{N}_{SI}(t) + \text{Poisson}\left[\mu_{SI} \left(\tilde{I}(t)\right) \tilde{S}(t)\delta \right]$

        1.  With mean equal to $\mu$

        2.  $\mu_{SI} \left(\tilde{I}(t)\right) = \beta \tilde{I}(t)$

    3.  A small issue that the Poisson distribution has a right tail that goes
        to infinity so could end up with more infections that number of
        susceptibles

2.  Binomial approximation

    1.  $\tilde{N}_{SI}(t+\delta) = \tilde{N}_{SI}(t) + \text{Binomial}\left[\tilde{S}(t), \mu_{SI} \left(\tilde{I}(t)\right) \delta\right]$

        1.  With mean equal to $np$ and variance $np(1-p)$

        2.  $p = \mu_{SI}\left(\tilde{I}(t)\right)\delta$

    2.  Avoids the issue with Poisson distribution, but if $\delta$ is not small
        enough then the probability $p$ can exceed 1

3.  Binomial approximation with exponential transition probabilities

    1.  $\tilde{N}_{SI}(t+\delta) = \tilde{N}_{SI}(t) + \text{Binomial}\left[\tilde{S}(t), 1 - \exp \{-\mu_{SI} \left(\tilde{I}(t)\right) \delta \} \right]$

        1.  Probability that they **fail to escape infection** is
            $1 - \exp \{-\mu_{SI} \left(\tilde{I}(t)\right) \delta \}$

## Euler's method vs Gillespie's algorith

-   [Gillespie's algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ruoTTLL5g) is an
    exact method for simulating continuous-time Markov chains

    -   Often approximated using *tau-leaping* methods, which is very closely
        related to Euler's method (sometimes called tau-leaping)

-   All possible reactions are written out with probabilities associated with it

    -   Random number generated selects which interaction will occur (weighted
        based on probabilities i.e., relative counts of compartment sizes ) and
        2nd random number generated selects when it will occur

    -   Compartment numbers (or cumulative counts) are updated and process
        restarts creating a single chain timeline

    -   Repeated many times to get a distribution of chains

-   Why use Euler's method that is an approximation:

    -   Think about:

        -   Numerical efficiency

            -   Have to have good random number generator

            -   Each chain has to be computed in sequence, and time will scale
                exponentially with number of potential interactions

        -   Importance of exactness when we don't know how realistic the model
            actually is

# Compartment models in `{pomp}`

## Consett measles outbreak case study

### Exploring up the data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
meas <- read_csv(paste0(
  "https://kingaa.github.io/sbied/stochsim/",
  "Measles_Consett_1948.csv"
  )) %>%
  select(week,reports=cases)

meas %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  head()

plot(meas, type = "o")
```

### SIR structure

-   Treat as fixed population size (sum of compartments)

-   Transitions modeled as stochastic processes

    -   Purely demographic i.e. each individual in a compartment at any given
        time faces the same risk of exiting the compartment

        -   Unavoidable randomness that arises from chance events occurring in a
            discrete and finite population

-   We will use the adjusted Binomial process for the unobserved state process$$
    \begin{aligned}
    \Delta N_{SI} &\sim \text{Binomial}\left[S, 1 - \exp \left\{-\beta \frac{I}{N} \Delta t \right\} \right] \\
    \Delta N_{IR} &\sim \text{Binomial}\left[I, 1 - \exp \left\{-\mu_{IR} \Delta t \right\} \right]
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    -   Where $\mu_{SI} = \beta \frac{I}{N}$ i.e., the **Force of Infection**

### SIR in R

```{r}
sir_step <- function (S, I, R, N, Beta, mu_IR, delta.t, ...) { 
  dN_SI <- rbinom(n = 1, size = S, prob = 1 - exp(-Beta * (I/N) * delta.t)) 
  dN_IR <- rbinom(n = 1, size = I, prob = 1 - exp(-mu_IR * delta.t))
  S <- S - dN_SI
  I <- I + dN_SI - dN_IR
  R <- R + dN_IR
  c(S = S, I = I, R = R)
}
```

We don't know how many individuals are susceptible to begin with, but we're
deciding that we start with a single infection (`I = 1`). We will estimate the
fraction susceptible as a parameter in the model (`eta`).

```{r}
 sir_rinit <- function (N, eta, ...) {
   c(S = round(N * eta), I = 1, R = round(N * (1 - eta)))
}
```

When setting up the `{pomp}` model, we must set $\delta$ sufficiently small on
the timescale of the day, i.e., we set to a day when the case reports are
weekly.

```{r}
library(pomp)
measSIR <- meas %>%
  pomp(
    times = "week", t0 = 0,
    rprocess = euler(sir_step, delta.t = 1/7),
    rinit = sir_rinit
    ) 
```

Now we need to connect out process to our measurements - there is a probability
associated with a case being reported! We assume that the individuals in each
week's `reports` are those transitioning from $I$ to $R$, and presumably this
observed process happens at a **lower transmission rate** than what happens in
the state process.

To adapt our model, we need an **accumulator variable** that keeps track of the
incidence over each week (an observation time step - our measurements come in
weeks but our state process is assumed to have daily time steps).

```{r}
sir_step <- function (S, I, R, H, N, Beta, mu_IR, delta.t, ...) { 
  dN_SI <- rbinom(n = 1, size = S, prob = 1 - exp(-Beta * (I/N) * delta.t)) 
  dN_IR <- rbinom(n = 1, size = I, prob = 1 - exp(-mu_IR * delta.t))
  S <- S - dN_SI
  I <- I + dN_SI - dN_IR
  R <- R + dN_IR
  H <- H + dN_IR
  
  c(S = S, I = I, R = R, H = H)
}
```

```{r}
sir_rinit <- function (N, eta, ...) {
   c(S = round(N * eta), I = 1, R = round(N * (1 - eta)), H = 0)
}
```

We can feed the `{pomp}` object back into the `pomp()` function and it updates
the relevant parts of the object, i.e., `rprocess` and `rinit`.

```{r}
measSIR <- measSIR %>% 
  pomp(
    rprocess = euler(sir_step, delta.t = 1/7),
    # accumvars resets H variable to 0 at the start of each measurement time 
    # step
    rinit = sir_rinit, accumvars = "H"
  )
```

Let's now model the data as a negative binomial process i.e.,
$\text{reports}_t = \text{NegBinom}(\rho H(t), k)$, and create either/both the
`dmeasure` or `rmeasure` components of the `pomp()` model.

```{r}
sir_dmeas <- function (reports, H, rho, k, log, ...) { 
  dnbinom(x = reports, size = k, mu = rho * H, log = log)
}

sir_rmeas <- function (H, rho, k, ...) { 
  c(reports = rnbinom(n = 1, size = k, mu = rho * H))
}
```

```{r}
measSIR <- measSIR %>% 
  pomp(
    rmeasure = sir_rmeas,
    dmeasure = sir_dmeas
  )
```

### SIR in C snippets

When simulating, we need something faster than R (which is interpreted), so
let's use C snippets that is facilitated by the `{pomp}` package. We have to
specify types in C, and also end each line with `;`. The `rbinom` function is
relatively similar, but has fewer arguments

```{r}
sir_step <- Csnippet("
  double dN_SI = rbinom(S, 1 - exp(-Beta * (I/N) * dt));
  double dN_IR = rbinom(I, 1 - exp(-mu_IR * dt));
  S -= dN_SI;
  I += dN_SI - dN_IR;
  R += dN_IR;
  H += dN_IR;
  ")
```

```{r}
sir_rinit <- Csnippet("
  S = nearbyint(eta * N);
  I = 1;
  R = nearbyint((1 - eta) * N);
  H = 0;
")
```

```{r}
sir_dmeas <- Csnippet("
  lik = dnbinom_mu(reports, k, rho * H, give_log);
  ")

sir_rmeas <- Csnippet("
  reports = rnbinom_mu(k, rho * H);
  ")
```

Specifying the model using C snippets is very similar to before, but we need to
tell `pomp()` which variables are the states, and which are the parameters.

```{r}
measSIR <- measSIR %>%
  pomp(
    rprocess = euler(sir_step, delta.t = 1/7),
    rinit = sir_rinit,
    rmeasure = sir_rmeas,
    dmeasure = sir_dmeas,
    accumvars = "H",
    statenames = c("S", "I", "R", "H"),
    paramnames = c("Beta", "mu_IR", "N", "eta", "rho", "k")
    )
```

### Plausibility of parameter values

Basic modelling theory tells us that for an SIR infection like measles,
$R_0 \approx \frac{L}{A}$ and $R_0 = - \frac{\log (1-f)}{f}$ where $f$ is the
final infected fraction. For $R_0 > 5, f>0.99$.

Assuming 50% reporting, given there were 521 infections, this means that
$S_0 \approx 1042, \eta = \frac{S_0}{N} \approx 0.027$. With an infectious
period of 2 weeks,
$1/\mu_{IR} \approx 2 \text{wk}, \beta = \mu_{IR}R_0 \approx 7.5 \text{wk}^{-1}$

Now let's simulate the data using our parameter values and see how good the
simulations fit the data.

```{r}
sims <- measSIR %>%
  simulate(
    params = c(
      Beta = 7.5, mu_IR = 0.5, rho = 0.5, k = 10,
      eta = 0.03, N = 38000
      ),
    nsim = 20, format = "data.frame", include.data = TRUE
  )
```

```{r}
sims %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = reports, group = .id, color = .id == "data")) +
  geom_line() +
  guides(color = FALSE)
```
