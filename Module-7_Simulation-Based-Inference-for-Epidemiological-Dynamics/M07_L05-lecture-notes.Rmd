# Introduction

## Challenges

-   Want to be able to include covariates e.g. age/rainfall etc

-   Real epidemiological systems:

    -   are nonlinear

    -   are stochastic e.g. in transmission

    -   are nonstationary

        -   There is a dependence on $t$ for what will happen in $\delta_t$

    -   continuous time

    -   hidden variables

    -   large measurement error

-   For measles, there are a number of specific mechanisms that have been
    proposed/evidence for, that introduce additional challenges

    -   High value of $R_0$

    -   under reporting

    -   seasonality e.g. with school terms

    -   changing birth rates affects dynamics

    -   birth-cohort effect

    -   spatial travelling waves

    -   fadeouts and reintroductions that scale with city size

    -   metapop dynamics

# Model and implementation

## Overview

-   Will look at case reports from 954 urban centers in England and Wales
    pre-vaccination

-   We examine questions regarding

    -   measles extinction and recolonization

    -   transmission rates

    -   seasonality

    -   resupply of susceptibles

-   The paper that produced this analysis can be found at He, Ionides, &
    King, J. R. Soc. Interface (2010)

### Data sets

## Modelling

-   We want to add an $E$ compartment, along with birth and deaths to help us
    address the issues seen in our SIR model on Consett

    -   Couldn't reconcile $\rho$ and $\mu_{IR}$

    -   Need to extra demographic stochasticity

-   Add covariates

    -   Birth rate

    -   Population size

-   Incorporate hypotheses

    -   Is there a birth delay effect?

        -   Does entry into $S$ happen when born, or when they become school
            age?

    -   cohort effect

        -   Sizeable proportion enter the susceptible class in a single day

            -   Use Dirac delta so that 0 everywhere except at 0 (i.e. delta of
                c=0 is non-0, otherwise no pulse of entry)

    $$
    \mu_{BS}(t) = (1-c)B(t-\tau) + c\delta(t-[t])\int_{t-1}^t B(t - \tau - s)ds \\
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{where}: c &= \text{cohort effect} \\
    \tau &= \text{school entry delay} \\
    [t] &= \text{most recent 1 Sept before } t
    \end{aligned}
    $$

-   Force of infection:

    -   Have to adapt classic equation to account for:

        -    importing of infection ($\iota$)

        -   Gamma white noise process ($\zeta$) to add extra stochastic
            (overdispersion)

            -   with intensity $\sigma_{SE}$

$$
\mu_{SE}(t) = \frac{\beta(t)}{N(t)}(I + \iota)^\alpha \zeta(t)
$$

-   Expect different transmission in and out of school term

    $$
    \beta(t) = 
    \begin{cases}
    \beta_0(1+a(1-p)/p) & \text{during term} \\ 
    \beta_0(1-a) & \text{during vacation} 
    \end{cases} \\
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{where}: a &= \text{amplitude of seasonality} \\
    p &= 0.7589 \text{ is the fraction of the year children are in school} \\
    (1-p)/p &= \text{ensures that the average transmission rate is } \beta_0
    \end{aligned}
    $$

-   Overdispersed binomial measurement model

    -   Normal distribution to make computations easier

$$
\text{cases}_t | \Delta N_{IR} = z_t \sim \text{Normal}(\rho z_t, \rho(1-\rho)z_t + (\psi \rho z_t)^2)
$$

## Model implementation in `{pomp}`

Here is the plot of the population and births per year. The red line indicates
the curve we will use that adjust for the cohort effect of a fraction of the
population entering the susceptible class at a single time point (when they go
to school).

### Process model

```{r}
set.seed(594709947L)
library(tidyverse)
library(pomp)

## ----rproc-------------------------------------------------
rproc <- Csnippet("
  double beta, br, seas, foi, dw, births;
  double rate[6], trans[6];
  
  // cohort effect
  if (fabs(t-floor(t)-251.0/365.0) < 0.5*dt)
    br = cohort*birthrate/dt + (1-cohort)*birthrate;
  else
    br = (1.0-cohort)*birthrate;

  // term-time seasonality
  t = (t-floor(t))*365.25;
  if ((t>=7 && t<=100) ||
      (t>=115 && t<=199) ||
      (t>=252 && t<=300) ||
      (t>=308 && t<=356))
      seas = 1.0+amplitude*0.2411/0.7589;
  else
      seas = 1.0-amplitude;

  // transmission rate
  beta = R0*(gamma+mu)*seas;

  // expected force of infection
  foi = beta*pow(I+iota,alpha)/pop;
  
  // white noise (extrademographic stochasticity)
  dw = rgammawn(sigmaSE,dt);
  
  rate[0] = foi*dw/dt;  // stochastic force of infection
  rate[1] = mu;         // natural S death
  rate[2] = sigma;      // rate of ending of latent stage
  rate[3] = mu;         // natural E death
  rate[4] = gamma;      // recovery
  rate[5] = mu;         // natural I death

  // Poisson births
  births = rpois(br*dt);
  
  // transitions between classes
  reulermultinom(2,S,&rate[0],dt,&trans[0]);
  reulermultinom(2,E,&rate[2],dt,&trans[2]);
  reulermultinom(2,I,&rate[4],dt,&trans[4]);

  S += births   - trans[0] - trans[1];
  E += trans[0] - trans[2] - trans[3];
  I += trans[2] - trans[4] - trans[5];
  R = pop - S - E - I;
  W += (dw - dt)/sigmaSE;  // standardized i.i.d. white noise
  C += trans[4];           // true incidence
")

```

### Initializing the states

```{r}
rinit <- Csnippet("
  double m = pop/(S_0+E_0+I_0+R_0);
  S = nearbyint(m*S_0);
  E = nearbyint(m*E_0);
  I = nearbyint(m*I_0);
  R = nearbyint(m*R_0);
  W = 0;
  C = 0;
")
```

### Measurement model

-   Model both under-reporting and measurement error
-   Take $C$ as the true incidence, therefore $E[\text{cases}|C] = \rho C$

```{r}
# Computes Pr=[cases | C]
dmeas <- Csnippet("
  double m = rho*C;
  double v = m*(1.0-rho+psi*psi*m);
  double tol = 0.0;
  if (cases > 0.0) {
    lik = pnorm(cases+0.5,m,sqrt(v)+tol,1,0)
           - pnorm(cases-0.5,m,sqrt(v)+tol,1,0) + tol;
  } else {
    lik = pnorm(cases+0.5,m,sqrt(v)+tol,1,0) + tol;
  }
  if (give_log) lik = log(lik);
")
```

```{r}
# Simulates cases | C
rmeas <- Csnippet("
  double m = rho*C;
  double v = m*(1.0-rho+psi*psi*m);
  double tol = 0.0;
  cases = rnorm(m,sqrt(v)+tol);
  if (cases > 0.0) {
    cases = nearbyint(cases);
  } else {
    cases = 0.0;
  }
")
```

### Constructing the pomp object

We want $C$ and $W$ to be accumulator variables

```{r}
dat %>%
  pomp(t0=with(dat,2*time[1]-time[2]),
    time="time",
    rprocess=euler(rproc,delta.t=1/365.25),
    rinit=rinit,
    dmeasure=dmeas,
    rmeasure=rmeas,
    covar=covariate_table(covar,times="time"),
    accumvars=c("C","W"),
    statenames=c("S","E","I","R","C","W"),
    paramnames=c("R0","mu","sigma","gamma","alpha","iota",
      "rho","sigmaSE","psi","cohort","amplitude",
      "S_0","E_0","I_0","R_0")
  ) -> m1
```

# Estimation

```{r}
library(doParallel); 
library(doRNG) 
registerDoParallel() 
registerDoRNG(998468235L) 

foreach(i=1:4, .combine=c) %dopar% {
  library(pomp)
  pfilter(m1,Np=10000,params=theta) 
  } -> pfs

logmeanexp(logLik(pfs),se=TRUE)
```

## Simulations

### At the MLE

```{r}
m1 %>%
  simulate(params=theta,nsim=3,format="d",include.data=TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=time,y=cases,group=.id,color=(.id=="data")))+
  guides(color=FALSE)+
  geom_line()+facet_wrap(~.id,ncol=2)
```

## Parameter estimation

-   Use parameter transformation to constrain the parameters, e.g. use logit to
    constrain between 0 and 1, and log to constrain \> 0
-   barycentric means they all need to sum to 1!

```{r}
pt <- parameter_trans(
  log=c("sigma","gamma","sigmaSE","psi","R0"),
  logit=c("cohort","amplitude"),
  barycentric=c("S_0","E_0","I_0","R_0")
)
```

# Findings

## Notable findings

### Importing infections

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-14%20at%209.47.34%20AM.png)

-   Use log scale for non-negative quantities

-   Quadratic for Hastings

    -   Indicator of good scale

-   Flat limit to left of London

    -   Almost no imported infections

    -   London is large so can sustain epidemic with no imported infections

        -   Only when imported rate is too large that it can't explain the data

-   Shift between London and Hasting

    -   Expect different number of visitors

### Seasonality

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-14%20at%209.49.59%20AM.png)

-   Agreement between cities

-   Wider CI in Hastings

    -   would expect more information in London therefore narrower

### Cohort effect

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-14%20at%209.50.57%20AM.png)

-   In London, is some evidence that it improves the model

    -   5-6 log unit improvements

### Birth delay

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-14%20at%209.51.46%20AM.png)

-   Although discrete, can treat as continuous
-   If imagine that the baby boom immediately go into S, then lose a lot of
    information!

### Reporting rate

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-14%20at%209.53.14%20AM.png)

-   Compare reporting rate from our model vs regression cumulative cases /
    cumulative births

-   Broadly speaking close agreement

    -   Few places where large discrepancy

### Predicted vs observed critical community size

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-14%20at%209.54.12%20AM.png)

-   Compute proportion of fade-outs (0s in the timeseries)

    -   In small places where measles fades out, expect to see a lot of weeks
        with 0s in the time series

-   As pop size gets larger, eventually pass critical community size

    -   Chains of transmission can remain unbroken/be sustained

    -   Proportion of 0s go down

-   Black dots is empirical data

-   Red line is prediction from model

## Problematic results

### $R_0$

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-14%20at%209.58.07%20AM.png)

-   When examining profile likelihood, estimates above conventionally accepted
    values in literature (15-20)

-   Could be bugs in coding/underlying assumptions

-   Could be the estimates in the literature are not correct!

    -   Criticise existing estimate

-   Where do $R_0$ estimates come from?

    -   Serological estimates using age of first infection $R_0 \approx L/A$

    -   Models fitted to data using feature-based approaches (not likelihood
        like this one)

        -   If models that use less information from the data agree with the
            serology, and we get different results using the same model
            structure on the same data, but with a method that uses more
            information, then it's likely a limitation of previous models!

-   Let's compare our $R_0$ with the mean age of first infection

    -   In our model, the mean age of first infection is actually
        $A = \frac{L}{R_0} + \text{birth delay}$

        -   If $L = R_0 = 50$, which are reasonable numbers considering our
            model/the time period

            -   $A = 1 + 4$ given 1 refers to the time **after entering the
                susceptible population!**

### Parameter estimates

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-14%20at%2010.12.32%20AM.png)

-   Let's look at the correlation between city size and the infectious period
    (IP)

    -   Shouldn't be correlated as it's a biological thing!

    -   Have to think about everything not modelled

        -   We use homogeneous mixing model, but this isn't realistic

            -   Might be that it needs to account for delays

-   Pop vs $\alpha$

    -   Supposed to account for homogeneity in some respect, but doesn't seem to
        be useful as it places it instead in IP!

    -   Sometimes our expectation of what a model should mean doesn't match up
        with what the model thinks when moving around dfs to best fit the data!

        -   Insight into which features of the data are showing up as
            important/not

-   Pop vs psi

    -   larger cities require less stochasticity in the model process

        -   Work more like clockwork

        -   smaller cities less predictable

            -   Have more high frequency variation that the model attributes to
                measurement error

-   Use models that compare across different regions to help show if you are
    actually estimating biologically stable parameters!

### Extra stochasticity

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-14%20at%2010.21.56%20AM.png)

-   London indicates we need the extra demographic noise vs Hastings

-   Can do traces of infectious and latent periods

    -   Balance the model fit vs corresponding with clinical values

        -   More corroboration with clinical values when lower $\sigma_{SE}$,
            but worse model fit. Possible explanation:

            -   If no extra demographic stochasticity, model doesn't have enough
                variability to explain data

            -   Demographic stochasticity relatively larger in smaller cities,
                i.e. wants to have really quick infectious and latent periods so
                fewer people in E and I classes, therefore more scope for
                demographic stochasticity to give flexibility to explain data

How do we interpret the need for extra demographic stochasticity in this model?
Let's simulate!
