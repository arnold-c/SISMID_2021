## About Simulation Based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics

This module introduces statistical inference techniques and computational
methods for dynamic models of epidemiological systems. The course will explore
deterministic and stochastic formulations of epidemiological dynamics and
develop inference methods appropriate for a range of models. Special emphasis
will be on exact and approximate likelihood as the key elements in parameter
estimation, hypothesis testing, and model selection. Specifically, the course
will cover sequential Monte Carlo, iterated filtering, and model criticism
techniques. Students will learn to implement these in R to carry out maximum
likelihood and Bayesian inference.

The majority of notes are taken from the course discussions and lectures led by 
Drs. Aaron King and Edward Ionides. The course website with full materials can
