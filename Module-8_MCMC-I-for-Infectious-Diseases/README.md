## About Simulation Based Inference for Epidemiological Dynamics

This module is an introduction to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The course 
includes a general introduction to Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo, and MCMC. Some 
relevant facts from the Markov chain theory are reviewed. Algorithms include Gibbs 
sampling and Metropolis-Hastings. A practical introduction to convergence diagnostics 
is included. Motivating practical examples range from generic toy problems to 
infectious disease applications, which include chain-binomial and general epidemic
models. A hierarchical model will be covered. The module will alternate between 
lectures and computer labs. Individuals already familiar with MCMC methods and 
knowledge of R programming should consider MCMC II.

The majority of notes are taken from the course discussions and lectures led by 
Drs. Kari Auranen, M. Elizabeth Halloran, Vladimir Minin. The course website with
