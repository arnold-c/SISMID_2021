# Multivariate situation

-   Often want to model multivariate situation
-   Hamiltonian Monte Carlo allows us to specify a Markov chain made up of
    multiple random variables

## Combining Markov kernels

-   Suppose we have 2 MH algorithms

    -   Each is a Markov chain with associated transition probability/density
        matrix

-
