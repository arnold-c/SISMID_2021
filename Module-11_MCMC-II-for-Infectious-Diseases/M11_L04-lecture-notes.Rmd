# Household models

-   Many ID studies incorporate households into study design

    -   Convenience of collecting data

    -   Stability of target pop

    -   Get data on within-household spread

-   Here, focus on models in which the households are independent

    -   May be reasonable if select households that are geographically separated

-   Assume population of $N$ individuals is partitioned into households

    -   No requirement that they are the same size

-   Household models require 2 key things

    -   How the disease enters household

        -   E.g. a community transmission risk

    -   What happens within a household

## How the disease enters a household

-   Typically assume each individual in population has a constant risk per unit
    time of becoming infected by the community

    -   Individually $k$ becomes infected according to a Poisson process of rate
        $b_k$

        -   Process that describes events happening randomly through time

        -   $P(k \text{ avoids infection for } T \text{ time units}) = \exp(-Tb_k)$

    -   The rate $b_k$ is typically the same for all individuals

    -   Can make rate $b_k$ depend on the **type** of individual $k$

        -   e.g. adult/child, vaccinated/unvaccinated etc

        -   More types require more data

## What happens within a household

-   Spread via SEIR model within household

-   Types may feature

    -   Infectivity and susceptibility of an individual may be type-dependent

-   Common assumption is that the infection rate $\beta$ is not scaled by the
    size of the household

    -   Each infective has contacts with each susceptible at rate $\beta$

    -   Normally, we assume infection rate for each infective individual
        $\propto \beta/N$

        -   At start of outbreak when $S \approx N$ therefore the overall rate
            $=\frac{\beta}{N}N = \beta$

        -   Therefore, if look at one individual the overall rate of them having
            infectious contacts is $\beta$, and independent of the population
            size!

            -   Frequency-dependent contact rate, e.g. don't expect to have many
                more contacts if you move from a small town to large city

    -   Within households, need to move to density-dependent contact rate

        -   Don't scale by $N$, so assume infection rate for each infective
            individual $\propto \beta N$

# Longitudinal data

-   We assume we have data through time e.g. daily observations

-   Approach the inference problem in a similar manner to SIR data

-   Have modelling process where we write down a likelihood and multiply by the
    priors of the parameters to get a density up to proportionality

-   Assuming households are independent

    -   If you can work out the likelihood of what happens in one household, the
        likelihood can be written as a product over all households

    -   Still likely have to do data augmentation steps as before

-   Now the parameter updates typically require M-H update steps within an MCM
    algorithm

## Worked example

-   Single household of $n=4$ individuals in which we observe 2 removals

-   Constant rate of outside infection $\lambda$

-   Markov SIR model for within-household transmission

-   Less constraint on when the infection times can happen

    -   i.e. Can be infected from outside the household, so infections no longer
        have to occur before everyone in the household has recovered

        ![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-20%20at%204.03.45%20PM.png){width="376"}

-   Augmented likelihood for the household

    -   Similar to before, but have updated the infection rate to include
        $\lambda$

    -   Now neither $\beta$ nor $\lambda$ have Gamma distributed full
        conditional distributions, but $\gamma$ still does

$$
\pi(i_2, r_1, r_2 | i_1, \beta, \gamma, \lambda) = (\beta I(i_2-)+\lambda) \exp\left(-\int_{i_1}^{r_2}(\beta S(t)I(t) + \lambda) dt\right) \times \gamma^2 \exp\left(-\gamma(r_1 + r_2 -i_1 - i_2\right)
$$

-   Augmented likelihood

    -   likelihood is the product of the likelihoods in household $k$

-   In constructing the posterior density, only need to include the prior
    density for the model parameters once (**not once per household**)

# Final outcome data

-   Suppose now the data consists only of **the final number of cases in each
    household**

-   Without any temporal data, we can't estimate all of the parameters with
    respect to **real time**

-   Therefore assume the infectious period is known and $E(T_I) = 1$

-   As before, assume households are independent so calculate likelihood for 1
    household and take product

-   Consider a household with $n$ individuals

-   Now let $T$ be the number who ever became infected ($0 \le T \le n$)

-   Assume constant rate of outside infection $\lambda$ and an SIR model for
    within-household contact with infection rate $\beta$

    -   Not talking about infectious period any more as assume mean = 1,
        therefore no gamma term

-   Wish to calculate $P(T=k), \quad k=0, …, n$

## Removing time

-   If we think about the final outcome in the correct way, it's possible to
    ignore the timing of events e.g. whether infections came first from outside
    or inside

### Ignoring external infections

-   To start, let's look at a single household and ignore external infections

-   Let's look at individual $A$.

    -   If $A$ ever infected, they remain so for random time $T_I$, e.g.
        $T_I = \tau$

    -   For a period of time $\tau$, they have contacts with other household
        individuals according to $n-1$ independent Poisson procesess, each with
        rate $\beta$

    -   Can write a list of individuals A would infected if the others were
        susceptible

-   Each individual in the population has a list

    -   Who would you infect if you were infective and everyone else was
        susceptible?

-   Can deduce who ends up getting infected!

-   Let's imagine we have all the lists below:

    -   $1 = \{4, 5\},\quad 2 = \{4, 1, 5\},\quad 3 = \{1\},\quad 4 = \{2\},\quad 5 = \{\}$

    -   1 is the initial infection

    -   1 infects 4 and 5

    -   4 infects 2

    -   2 only infects 5 as 4 and 1 aren't susceptible

    -   5 doesn't infect anyone

        ![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-20%20at%204.28.48%20PM.png){width="347"}

-   The distribution of the final number infected in the epidemic is the same as
    the distribution of the number of individuals found on the final list (who
    ultimately got infected)

-   All we care about is if the person gets infected, not who was the cause of
    each infection

### Adding external infections

-   Need to find out which individuals become infected from outside the
    household

    -   Again, don't need to know when they become infected

-   Treat individuals infected from outside as if they are initial infections
    within the household

    -   Now have SIR model within the household with our calculated number of
        initial infections

-   Probability of avoiding infection from outside the household during time $t$
    becomes the probability they avoid infection during the entire epidemic

    -   $p = \exp(-\lambda t)$

    -   If looking at seasonal data, effectively assuming epidemic is finished
        at end of season

-   Assuming each individual in household avoids external infection independent
    of each other, it follows a Binomial distribution

    -   $Y \sim \text{Binom}(n, 1-p)$

-   We are interested in $P(T=k)$

    -   $P(T=k) = \sum_{0 \le y \le n}P(T=k | Y=y)P(Y=y)$

        -   Where $P(Y=y) = \frac{n!}{(n-y)!y!} (1-p)^y (p)^{n-y}$

            -   Probability that $y$ number of individuals in the household did
                get infected

        -   Indicates that $k-y$ individuals have to get infected inside the
            household

        -   Sum over all possible values

            -   However, some probabilities can be 0, e.g. when $y>k$ as $k$ is
                the total number of individuals infected

    -   $P(T=k | Y=y)$ is the probability that $k-y$ susceptibles become
        infected in and SIR model with $y$ initial infectives and $n-y$
        susceptibles

        -   We can evaluate with "triangular equations" for an SIR model

#### Triangular equations for an SIR model

-   Consider SIR model with $m$ initial susceptibles, $a$ initial infectives,
    and $\alpha$ is the infection rate between two individuals

-   Define $p(k)$ as the probability $k$ of initial susceptibles ever become
    infected ($k=0, 1, …, m$)

-   Let $f(x)=E[\exp(-x T_I)]$ be the moment generating function of the
    infectious period distribution

-   For $0\le j\le m$:

    -   $\sum_{k=0}^j \binom{m-k}{j-k} \frac{p(k)}{\left[f(\alpha(m-j))\right]^{k+a}} = \binom{m}{j}$

    -   Evaluate recursively by setting $j=0, \quad j=1, \quad ..., \quad j=m$
        to get $p(0), p(1), …, p(m)$

-   For example

    -   Set $T_I$ = 1, then $f(x) = E[\exp(-x)]$

    -   Setting $j=0$ gives:

        -   $p(0) = \exp(-3\alpha)$

    -   Setting $j=1$ gives:

        -   $3p(0)\exp(2 \alpha) + p(1)\exp(4 \alpha) = 3$

        -   $p(1) = 3\exp(-4\alpha)(1-\exp(-\alpha))$

-   Note that this requires a **recursive function**

#### Data and likelihood

-   Suppose we have data consisting of the set of numbers
    $\vec{n} = \{n(j, k)\}$

    -   $n(j, k)$ is the number of household in which $j$ out of $k$ initial
        susceptibles become infected

-   The likelihood takes the form

    -   $\pi(\vec{n}|p, \beta) = \prod_{j,k}q(j,k)^{n(j,k)}$

        -   Remember that $p$ is the probability of escaping infection

        -   $\beta$ is used in the triangular equations instead of $\alpha$

        -   $q(j,k) = P(T=j)$ for a household containing $k$ susceptible
            individuals

            -   It isn't explicitly written down but we can numerically
                calculate it

-   The target density is:

    -   $\pi(p, \beta, | \vec{n}) \propto \pi(\vec{n}|p, \beta) \pi(p, \beta)$

    -   $p$ is a probability and could be updated by Gaussian random walk ($p<0$
        and $p>1$ must be rejected), or an independence sampler (e.g.
        $\text{U}[0, 1]$), for example

        -   $\beta^* \sim \mathcal{N}(\beta, \sigma^2)$

#### Fixed infectious periods

-   Because we're thinking about final outcome data, there is no time
    information

-   Let's look at the special case where $T_I=1$

-   The triangular equations yield expressions in terms of
    $f(x) = E[\exp(-xT_I)] = \exp(-x)$

    -   The only difference between different choices of $T_I$ is how different
        are the moment generating functions i.e., if not that different, don't
        see much difference in the inference for the parameters in the model
        e.g. $p, \beta$

    -   $\sum_{k=0}^j \binom{m-k}{j-k} \frac{p(k)}{\left[f(\beta(m-j))\right]^{k+a}} = \binom{m}{j}$

        -   Note we've reparamaterized this using $\beta$ (our infection rate)
            instead of $\alpha$

    -   $\left[f(\beta(m-j))\right]^{k+a} = \exp\left(-\beta(m-j)(k+a)\right) = q^{(m-j)(k+a)}$

        -   Where $q=\exp(-\beta)$

    -   Now, we can put our parameters $p, q$ in context (for individual $A$)

        -   $p = P(A \text{ avoids external infection})$

        -   $q = P(A \text{ avoids infection from one infected household member})$

            -   This arises from the Poisson process assumption:

            -   How likely is it that there are no points in a Poisson process
                that you observe for length one time period (because $T_I=1$)
                where the rate of events is $\beta$

-   The within-household model has the same final outcome distribution as the
    Reed-Frost model

-   The whole model has the same final outcome distribution as the
    Longini-Koopman model

# Discussion

## Why use this household model vs Reed-Frost

-   Reed-frost is discrete case, but has strong assumptions about long latent
    period and fixed length infection period

-   Household model is more general and makes fewer assumptions

    -   Can have different infectious period distributions

    -   Continuous time so can incorporate other data with temporal data
