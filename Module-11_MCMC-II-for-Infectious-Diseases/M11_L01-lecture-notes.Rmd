# Simulation

## Introducing simulation

-   Suppose we have a stochastic epidemic model (e.g. SIR)

-   Simulation = producing a realisation of the model (i.e. possible outcome)

    -   Producing an outcome according to the correct distribution of all
        possible outcomes

-   For the SIR model

    -   producing a set of infection and removal times according to the correct
        distribution inherent in the model

-   Why is it useful?

    -   Helps us understand model behaviour

    -   It is useful for testing our inference procedure (finding or estimating
        model parameters) e.g. validate our method against data from the
        simulation where we know the "truth"

-   For example:

    -   Perform N (=1000) simulations

    -   Have model with parameter vector $\theta$ fixed at $\theta_T$

    -   For each simulation, estimate the model parameters to get
        $\theta_1, ..., \theta_N$

    -   The average of the model estimates should be close to the true value of
        $\theta_T$

-   Also useful for model checking

    -   Let's say we estimate model parameter $\alpha$

    -   For each value of $\alpha$, we perform a large number of simulations and
        see whether the output of each is similar to the actual data

-   Suppose we have a mixture model, e.g. looking at seroprevalence data where
    some people infected and others aren't, and $x_k$ is the IgG value

    -   $x_k \sim N(0, 1)$ with probability 0.5, and $x_k \sim N(10, 1)$, if we
        just fit a single parameter, we will be way off and we can check our
        predictions against the data to show that our model guess will never
        look like the data

-   Simulations can be used for prediction

    -   e.g. estimate epidemic model parameters up to time T and simulate
        forward using these estimates

## Simulating Markov models

-   Let the state space be denoted $S = \{1, 2, 3, ..., n \}$

    -   S is the set of states the MC can visit and each state can be
        multidimensional

-   We care about the tendency of the chain to move from $i \to j$

    -   $\Pr(X(t+dt) = j |X(t) = i) = q_{ij}dt + o(dt)$

-   The chain stays in state $i$ for time $T_i$

    -   $T_i \sim \text{Exp}(\sum_{j \ne i} q_{ij})$

    -   $P(T_i > t) = \exp(-\sum_{j \ne i} q_{ij})$

-   When it leaves state $i$, the chain jumps to state $j$ with probability
    $q_{ij} / \sum_{j \ne i} q_{ij}$

-   The time spent in state $i$ and the choice of where to jump to **are
    independent**, and they are also independent of the same quantities in other
    states and at other times

### Gillespie algorithm (next event simulation)

-   All that is needed is to generate the time spent in a state, and the next
    state that is visited

Algorithm:

![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-19%20at%2011.34.24%20AM.png)

-   Initialise (t=0, X(0) = x0)

-   for state $i$:

    -   Calculate L (sum of the jump rates out of state i)

        -   $L= \sum_{j \ne i} q_{ij}$

    -   Generate time spent in state $i$

        -   $T_i \sim \text{Exp}(L)$

    -   Sample from a uniform distribution ($u = \text{U}[0, 1]$)

    -   If $u < \frac{\sum_{j \le 1, j \ne i} q_{ij}}{L}$

        -   $k=1$
        -   Divide by $L$ to normalize so it's between 0 and 1

    -   Else if $u < \frac{\sum_{j \le 2, j \ne i} q_{ij}}{L}$

        -   $k=2$

    -   Continue until $k$ determined

        ![](images/Screen%20Shot%202021-07-19%20at%2011.43.43%20AM.png)

    -   Update current time

    -   Record $t$ and $k$

        -   Time of next event = $t+T_i$

        -   State jumped to is $k$

-   The algorithm outputs a sequence of times ($t_k$) and a corresponding
    sequence of states ($x_k$)

### Example: general epidemic model (SIR)

-   Due to the Poisson process infection mechanism and exponentially distributed
    infectious period

    -   $\{ [S(t), I(t)]:t\ge0 \}$

-   If the chain is currently at $(s, i)$, then it can jump to:

    -   $(s-1, i+1)$ (infection) at rate $\beta si/N$

    -   $(s, i-1)$ (removal) at rate $\gamma i$

-   Therefore, the time spent in $(s, i)$

    -   $T_{(s, i)} \sim \text{Exp}([\beta si/N] + \gamma i)$

-   Once the chain leaves $(s, i)$

    -   Probability of infection
        $(s-1, i+1): \quad \frac{\beta s}{\beta s + N\gamma}$

    -   Probability of recovery
        $(s, i-1): \quad \frac{N\gamma}{\beta s + N\gamma}$

    -   Calculate probabilities by dividing rate of interest by sum of the rates

-   Apply the algorithm iteratively

-   Can sometimes be useful to keep track of the type of each event e.g.
    infection or recovery

## Simulating non-Markov models

-   Same idea as before

    -   Generating time until next event

    -   But independence properties of Markov chain are lost so we need to
        explicitly generate the times of future events as the algorithm evolves

-   In the Markov SIR model:

    -   Infections occur according to a Poisson process of rate
        $\beta S_t I_t /N$

    -   Each infective remains so for a period of time
        $T_I \sim \text{Exp}(\gamma)$

-   In the non-Markov SIR model

    -   A common generalisation is to let the infectious period distribution
        $T_I$ be non-exponential e.g. constant, Gamma

    -   Infectious period $T_I$ drawn from specified distribution with parameter
        vector $\theta$

    -   Now two model parameters $\beta$ and $\theta$

-   To simulate the epidemic

    -   Generate removal time of each individual as they become infected

        -   The time of next removal is known, as is the identity of the removed
            individual

    -   Generate possible time-to-next infection

        -   $T \sim \text{Exp}(\beta si /N)$

        -   If $T <$ time of next removal, next event is an infection

            -   Otherwise, next removal occurs

            -   If removal occurs first, then $i$ in
                $T \sim \text{Exp}(\beta si /N)$ changes, so we no longer have
                the correct distribution for time to next infection and it needs
                to be updated

### Example: non-Markov SIR model

-   Lets assume we have a fixed infectious period

    -   $T_I = c$

-   We need $\vec{r}$ which contains the removal times of all the current
    infectives

-   Initialize:

    -   $S = N-1$

    -   $I = 1$

    -   $t=0$

    -   $\vec{r} = (c)$

        -   We only have one infective, so $\vec{r}$ only contains 1 removal
            time ($0+c$)

-   While $i>0$:

    -   $T\sim \text{Exp}(\beta SI/N)$

        -   Draw from the infectious period distribution

    -   $R=\min(r)$

        -   Time of the next removal

    -   if $t + T < R$ (current time + potential time to next infection \< time
        of next removal)

        -   $S = S-1, I = I+1$

        -   Add new removal time $r \leftarrow (t+T+c)$

        -   Update current time $t=t+T$

# Discussion

## When infections and removals happen at the same time, do we consider to be Markov or non-Markov

Things are actually happening instantaneously, it's just that we make them
discrete when we aggregate data.

## In the non-Markov model example, the time to infection is exponential, so why is it not a Markov model

-   The joint distribution of the number of susceptibles and infected at each
    time

    -   Markov model is a markov chain

    -   Not a markov chain in non-markov model as infectious period distribution
        is non-exponential
