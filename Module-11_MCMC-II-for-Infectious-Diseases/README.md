## About MCMC II for Infectious Diseases

This module looks in detail at practical implementation issues for MCMC methods
when applied to data from infectious disease outbreaks. The main focus will be
towards inference for the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model. Topics
include parameterization, methods for improving convergence, assessing MCMC
output, and data augmentation methods. Programming will be carried out in R.
